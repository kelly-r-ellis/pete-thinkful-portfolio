This project is to practice and present the HTML and CSS skills I have learned thus far. 

Examples include:
* Relative Links
* Adding appropriate containers
* Simple CSS styling 

Special thanks to the Thinkful team for providing the user interface mockup and starting code. Thank you to the grading team for reviewing my work!
